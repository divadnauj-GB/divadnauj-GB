## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my page; here, you can find most of the repositories I am working on. The repositories comprise a wide spectrum of flavors, including but not limited to:

- Advanced digital design for FPGAs
- Computational arithmetic for AI
- Accelerators for vision applications
- Functional in-field testing of hardware components (e.g., CPUs, and GPUs)
- Dependability and fault tolerance for AI accelerators
- AI reliability assessment (i.e., error modeling of hardware faults).

I encourage you to have a look at my work and feel free to contact me for queries, suggestions, or comments that can help to improve the work available here ðŸ˜Š.
